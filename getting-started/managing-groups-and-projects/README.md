# Managing Groups and Projects

* Access to the software's capabilities is divided by layers.
* The first layer is _Groups_, and the second layer is _Projects._
* Users can only enter groups, and therefore projects, to which they have been assigned by the administrator.

To change between groups and/or projects:

1. After logging in, click on the _User_ icon on the right side of the screen.
2. Use the drop-down menu next to _Group_ to select a group that has been assigned to your profile.
3. Use the drop-down menu next to _Project_ to select a project within the selected group.
