# Databases/Warehouses

Some of the databases and warehouse available when clicking on _Add New Connection_ might require more information than the one shown in the previous section, or could have extra options.

## Redshift

To add a Redshift connection, you will have to provide:

* Connection name, which you will assign to this connection for internal use.
* A JDBC URL. A sample JDBC URL is shown under this text.

> jdbc:redshift://redshift-cluster-1.XXXXXXXXXX.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/dev?ssl=false

* Credentials, which will be a username and a password that will provide access to this database.

Optionally, you may provide _s3TempDir_ and _s3AwsIamRole_ for better performance, as explained in the following link.

> **s3TempDir**
>
> s3n://**\<S3\_Bucket>**/
>
> **s3AwsIamRole**
>
> arn:aws:iam::**XYZ**:role/Redshift\_Role

2. information\_schema.views

## SQL Server

To add an SQL Server connection, you will have to provide:

* Credentials, which will be a username and a password that will provide access to this database.

If SSL is enabled, additional parameters will be required for the JDBC URL as shown under this text.

> jdbc:postgresql://\<jdbcHost>:XXXX/\<jdbcDatabaseName>\&ssl=true\*\*\&sslmode=require\&sslfactory=org.postgresql.ssl.NonValidatingFactory\*\*

information_schema.columns
pg_namespace
pg_catalog
```



## Snowflake
