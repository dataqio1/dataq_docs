# Databases/Warehouses

Some of the databases and warehouse available when clicking on _Add New Connection_ might require more information than the one shown in the previous section, or could have extra options.

## Redshift

To add a Redshift connection, you will have to provide:

* Connection name, which you will assign to this connection for internal use.
* A JDBC URL. A sample JDBC URL is shown under this text.

> jdbc:redshift://redshift-cluster-1.XXXXXXXXXX.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/dev?ssl=false

* Credentials, which will be a username and a password that will provide access to this database.

Optionally, you may provide _s3TempDir_ and _s3AwsIamRole_ for better performance, as explained in the following link.

{% embed url="https://awsdba.cloud/2019/05/10/redshift-iam-role-for-copy-unload-to-s3/" %}

> **s3TempDir**
>
> s3n://**\<S3\_Bucket>**/
>
> **s3AwsIamRole**
>
> arn:aws:iam::**XYZ**:role/Redshift\_Role

It is recommended to create a read only user account in Redshift. The user id needs to have access to the following system tables to read the metadata of all the tables.

1. svv\_table\_info
2. information\_schema.views

## SQL Server

To add an SQL Server connection, you will have to provide:

* Connection name, which you will assign to this connection for internal use.

2. sys.columns
3. sys.types
4. sys.indexes
5. sys.index\_columns

* Credentials, which will be a username and a password that will provide access to this database.

If SSL is enabled, additional parameters will be required for the JDBC URL as shown under this text.

> jdbc:postgresql://\<jdbcHost>:XXXX/\<jdbcDatabaseName>\&ssl=true\*\*\&sslmode=require\&sslfactory=org.postgresql.ssl.NonValidatingFactory\*\*

```
pg_class
information_schema.table_constraints
information_schema.columns
pg_namespace
pg_catalog
```

## Snowflake

To add a Snowflake connection, you will have to provide:

* Connection name, which you will assign to this connection for internal use.
* A JDBC URL. A sample JDBC URL is shown under this text.

> jdbc:snowflake://XXX72530.us-east-1.snowflakecomputing.com/?db=\<jdbcDatabaseName>\&schema=\<schemaName>

* Credentials, which will be a username and a password that will provide access to this database.
