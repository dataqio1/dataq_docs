# Test Runs

The Test Runs page displays test runs for the selected duration (Date Range)  and for the selected project. The name of the selected project is displayed at the top left. By default, the page shows tests executed in the last week, but the duration can be changed as needed.

### View All Tests in Running and  Waiting State

Additionally, you can view all the tests that are currently running or in a waiting state by clicking the bell icon at the top right. The number displayed on top of the bell icon represents the total tests that are either running or in a waiting state.

## Batch Results

Tests are grouped into batches based on how they are executed. If only one test case is executed, the batch will contain only one test case execution. You can view all the tests in a batch by clicking the expand icon on the left.

#### Run a Batch of Tests

By clicking the play button next to a batch, you can initiate the execution of all tests within that batch. This allows for efficient management and execution of multiple test cases simultaneously.

#### Manage Test Cases in a Batch

In addition to executing tests, you have the option to delete a test case from a batch. This action can be performed to remove unwanted or irrelevant test cases, ensuring that your batch contains only the necessary tests. Simply click the delete icon next to the test case to remove it from the batch.

#### Merge Batches into a Super Batch

For further efficiency, you can merge multiple batches to create a super batch. This feature enables you to execute several sets of test cases as a single entity, simplifying the management of extensive test scenarios. Click the merge icon next to selected batches to combine them into a super batch.
