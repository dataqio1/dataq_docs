# Test Runs

The Test Runs page displays test runs for the selected duration (Date Range)  and for the selected project. The name of the selected project is displayed at the top left. By default, the page shows tests executed in the last week, but the duration can be changed as needed.

### Batch Results

Tests are grouped into batches based on how they are executed. If only one test case is executed, the batch will contain only one test case execution. You can view all the tests in a batch by clicking the expand icon on the left.

• Green indicates a test pass.
