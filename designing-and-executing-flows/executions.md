# Test Runs

The Test Runs page displays test runs for the selected duration (Date Range)  and for the selected project. The name of the selected project is displayed at the top left. By default, the page shows tests executed in the last week, but the duration can be changed as needed.

Tests are grouped into batches based on how they are executed. If only one test case is executed, the batch will contain only one test case execution. You can view all the tests in a batch by clicking the expand icon on the left.

In the Status column, the execution status of the test cases is displayed as a bar:\


• Green indicates a test pass.

• Red indicates a test fail.

• Blue indicates a test exception.

• Grey indicates tests that are currently running.

You can rerun the batch by clicking the triangle icon next to the test run status bar. Additionally, you can view all the tests that are currently running or in a waiting state by clicking the bell icon at the top right. The number displayed on top of the bell icon represents the total tests that are either running or in a waiting state.
