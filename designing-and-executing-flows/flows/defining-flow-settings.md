# Defining Flow Settings

* Flow settings can be defined in a per-flow basis.
* Following are the flow settings which can be set at flow level. Users can access these settings by clicking on the three-slider bar icon on the top-right of the screen, nest to the _Result_ button.
  * **Execute\_on** is a setting used to specify where this flow will be executed. A list of server cluster managers is provided in the dropdown menu, and it can be set to an AWS environment, Databricks, or on the local server.
