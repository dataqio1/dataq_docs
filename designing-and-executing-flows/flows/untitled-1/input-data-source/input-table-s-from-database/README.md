#### Advanced Options

For large tables, it is recommended to provide a partition column so Vexdata can pull the data in parallel. Vexdata can autodetect the partition column; however, it is recommended that users provide this partition.

**Rules for selecting the partition column :**

* The column should have an index.
* The column should be numeric or a date-column.
* If the column is of string-type, ensure the bucket size is not too low for a distinct value.
  * Example : If you have to choose between city and person\_name, select city as partition column, as person\_name is highly unique.
