# Create Flows

Flows, or test cases, are the main procedure through which data is compared in DataQ. A flow can be created by dropping shapes from a palette containing different icons onto a canvas, which are then connected and configured to obtain the desired data comparisons.

To create a new flow, click on the _Plus_ circular icon that will be visible on the top-right of your screen, next to the name of the currently logged-in user. After clicking on this button, a white canvas will open, with the action's palette visible on the left edge.
