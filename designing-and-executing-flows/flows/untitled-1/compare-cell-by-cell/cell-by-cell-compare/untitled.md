# Data Compare Mapping

* **SQL Transformation** : This feature can be used to apply an SQL Transformation function for all the _Source_ and _Target_ columns. This can be helpful, for instance, if in one of the columns from either _Source_ or _Target_ the name has been written with uppercase, and the corresponding column from the other data source has the name in lowercase. The _SQL Transformation_ can be used to write an SQL statement to change the column's names to uppercase. To do this:
  * Click on the icon under the _SQL_ column.
  * Provide the _SQL_ function in the _Text Field_ and click on _Done,_ or... 
  * Slide the toggle and add predefined rules.
  * Go to Settings for [Add New Rule](https://app.gitbook.com/@dataq/s/docs/~/drafts/-MWOAN922BH54Ft3iFk_/settings) functionality.

 **Tolerance** : Users can apply _Tolerance_ for all integer column data types, e.g., long, double, float, short, int., to have a tolerance for the comparison to succeed even if the data is not perfectly matching. _Tolerance_ cannot be added to the key column.

* Click on the icon under _Tolerance._
* Select the _Operator_ and _Value._
* Click on _Done._
