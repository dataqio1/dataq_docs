# Schema Compare

Schema comparison is a process that identifies differences between database object definitions. It can be used to compare two schemas within a single database, or between a database and any other dataset.

## Benefits of schema Comparison are -&#x20;

* Ensures consistency between environments.&#x20;
* Prevents runtime errors caused by mismatched schemas.&#x20;
* Speeds up deployment and migration processes.
* Helps in detecting and fixing schema drift (unintended changes).
