# Labels

## Test Case Labels

Labels in VexData help you organize, categorize, and manage your test cases. Tag test cases with custom labels to create logical groupings that make it easier to find, filter, and manage your data quality tests.

### Overview

Labels allow you to:

* Categorize test cases by business function, data source, or testing purpose
* Filter and search test cases using label-based criteria
* Group related tests for better organization
* Streamline batch creation by selecting tests with specific labels

#### Viewing Labels

Labels appear as colored tags in the **Labels** column of the test case list. **Some examples** :

* **Oracle To SF** - Migration-related tests
* **Web Sales Data** - E-commerce data validation
* **DQ test cases** - Data quality validations
* **ETL test cases** - Extract, Transform, Load tests



#### Filtering by Labels

1. Click the Labels dropdown in the filter section
2. Select one or more labels from available options
3. The test case list updates to show only tests with selected labels
4. Clear filters to see all test cases again

#### Managing Labels

Access label management through **More > Manage Labels**:

* Create new labels that match your organization's needs
* Edit existing label names or colors
* Delete unused labels

### Label Organization Strategies

* **Product Catalog** - Product information tests

#### By Data Source

* **Salesforce** - Salesforce data tests
* **Oracle Database** - Oracle system tests
* **CSV Files** - File-based data tests

#### By Test Purpose

* **Accuracy** - Data correctness tests

### Working with Labeled Test Cases

#### Batch Creation

* Filter test cases by specific labels
* Select multiple test cases with the same label
* Create focused batches for specific business areas

#### Bulk Operations
