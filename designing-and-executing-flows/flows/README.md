Each Test Case under the _Action_ column has seven available actions, which can be accessed by clicking on the three-dots icon next to the check box. These actions are:



```
**1. Edit**  -Feature Overview
Previously, clicking on a test case action redirected users to the edit canvas of that 
specific test case. With the latest UI update, users can now seamlessly access and 
switch between the canvas views of multiple test casesâ€”enabling faster review, editing, 
and comparison.
