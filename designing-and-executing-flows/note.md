# Note

Notes are the brief/ descriptive title for the test case. It may contain detailed description of what is being tested or any conditions that must be met before executing the test. It may also include specific data to be used in the test or what you expect to happen after executing the test steps. Any conditions that should be met after the test is executed can be mentioned along with the actual outcome of the test execution criteria to determine if the test case passed or failed. We may also include any additional information or observations or any information about the environment
